## Replication code for ``When Algorithms Import Private Bias into Public Enforcement: The Promise and Limitations of Statistical De-Biasing Solutions''

### Documentation
This repository contains all the corresponding code to replicate tables and figures in ``When Algorithms Import Private Bias into Public Enforcement: The Promise and Limitations of Statistical De-Biasing Solutions''.

### Directions
1. Save the raw Yelp data called 'instances_mergerd_seattle.csv' from Kang et al. 2013 <a href="http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~junkang/hygiene/">[link]</a> to the data folder in this repo.

2. Code organization assumes the working directory is the same as the code, so that data is read relative to a code's subfolder.

3. [Finish]
